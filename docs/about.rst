About FUC
==========

Frequently Used Commands (`FUC <https://github.com/PingjunChen/FUC>`_) is a
collection of most commonly used tools in routine programming under Ubuntu or Mac OS.
The purpose is to gather those easy-to-forget commands. Since I always forget
and need to Google around, why not organize them together?

If you find or think of any commands or tools that would be helpful for routine work,
please `issue <https://github.com/PingjunChen/FUC/issues>`_ or
`pull request <https://github.com/PingjunChen/FUC/pulls>`_.
