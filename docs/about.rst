About FUC
==========

Frequently Used Commands (FUC) is a collection of most commonly used tools in routine
programming under Ubuntu or Mac OS. The purpose for this repo is to gather those
easy-to-forget commands. As I always need to Google around to find them, why not organize
them together?

If you find any commands or tools that would be really helpful for routine work,
please issue or pull request.
